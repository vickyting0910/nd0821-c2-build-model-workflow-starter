# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC

This project builds the ML pipeline for bettter prediction accuracy using random forest model. This pipeline is built by Weights & Biases (wandb). 

The Weights & Biases project is under https://wandb.ai/vickyliau/nyc_airbnb?workspace=user-vickyliau

## Furture Extensions for future release
### Test with different models, such gradient boosting model: 

Instead of reducing variances, reducing bias may work better. 

### Apply Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning

### Apply more data cleaning steps, such as more imputation methods

## Refereences
The code is revised from two sources:
